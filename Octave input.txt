To read a file which contains data into Octave .. use 
[val,count] = fscanf(fid, template, {number of conversions})
the template is like C .. "%d" .. "%x" .. "%f"
fid is the file id from ..   fid = fopen ("filename", "r")
if number of conversions is not specified it defaults to all until EOF

returns an array of values .. val
and the count of how many values were converted
